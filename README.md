# üìö InfoPedia

## üöÄ Project Overview

**InfoPedia** is a web app I built as part of my learning journey, where I dived into **NextJS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. This project gave me practical hands-on experience with these modern technologies and helped me understand the intricacies of server-side rendering, client-side components, and how Tailwind simplifies the CSS workflow.

While this was a guided tutorial, I implemented and customised various parts of the project to make it my own, adapting what I learned and applying it to my coding style. **InfoPedia** allowed me to solidify the concepts, which I later used to build more complex projects like **AI Fitness**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **NextJS**: Understanding **server-side rendering** and **static generation** allowed me to create a dynamic, fast-loading web app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind simplified styling, giving me a utility-first approach to designing clean and responsive UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Added static typing and enhanced code reliability by catching potential errors during development.
- **Search Feature**: A search component that dynamically fetches and displays information from external APIs like **Wikipedia**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - Learning how to build React applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For rapid styling using utility classes.
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Strong typing, making the code more maintainable and less error-prone.

## üîç Learning Outcomes

- **NextJS**: Before this project, I hadn‚Äôt worked much with SSR (Server-Side Rendering) or SSG (Static Site Generation). InfoPedia gave me a deep understanding of how NextJS optimizes performance with these techniques.
  
- **Tailwind CSS**: This was my first experience with Tailwind CSS, and I loved how it made styling so quick and flexible. The utility-first approach helped me avoid repetitive class definitions and achieve responsiveness easily.
  
- **TypeScript**: Working with TypeScript made me appreciate the benefits of strong typing, particularly how it catches potential issues early in the development process.

Through **InfoPedia**, I gained the confidence to tackle more complex apps, and it laid a solid foundation for my next project, **AI Fitness**, where I expanded my understanding of full-stack development.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Search for Information**: Users can search for topics via a search bar, which fetches data from Wikipedia and dynamically displays the results.
   
2. **Navigate with Navbar**: Use the navbar to quickly navigate between different sections of the site.

3. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

## üèÜ Achievements

Working on **InfoPedia** helped me develop a solid understanding of how to structure and build applications with **NextJS**, how to efficiently style with **Tailwind CSS**, and how to benefit from **TypeScript‚Äôs** strong typing. The project gave me a great foundation to tackle more challenging projects in the future.

## üéØ Overall

**InfoPedia** was a stepping stone that bridged my front-end experience into more advanced full-stack concepts. This project taught me how modern frameworks and styling systems could accelerate my development process while maintaining scalability and performance. It also paved the way for more complex projects like **AI Fitness**, where I combined these skills with APIs and AI to build something more powerful.
